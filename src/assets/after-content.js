      title: '(4.1) Be prepared to move back to an ‘almost-completed’ building',
      content: `With this piece of advice, I again want to emphasize that every resyndication will be unique and
      come with its own set of circumstances. Due to the pressures from funders and various tax incentives, it
      is at least possible that the renovated property will re-open and begin returning its tenants before
      the building is 100% complete and ready-for-use in all spaces. As the on-site staff, it is the responsibility of RS
      staff and PM staff to continually advocate for the building’s needs. Following staff’s return to the
      Carlton, the first tenants to move back began arriving almost immediately and spent about 4 weeks
      without laundry machines or active internet/cable jacks. Other small inconvenient things were also
      still on back-order, or otherwise unfinished. For example, our PM purchased 100+ plastic storage
      bins to offer residents while they waited for their dressers to be delivered. If your resyndication has
      similar issues, all you can do is continually advocate for your tenants, who might blame you for
      things that are outside your control. Understand that this is natural, since after all you (along with
      other site staff from PM team) are the MHL employees that they see every day. Don’t take it
      personally.`

      title: '(4.2) Expect an expedited lease-up and prioritize responsibilities with supervisor',
      content: `Finally, depending on the specific circumstances of your building’s resyndication, you
      may be expected to deal with a rapid lease-up process, in addition to supporting tenants in
      their moves back and handling some of the potential challenges described above. During
      relocation the property may lose tenants through normal attrition (death, residents finding
      other housing opportunities, moving out-of-state), so upon return the occupancy rate
      will be lower. At the Carlton, this occupancy metric was tied to the renovation funding in such
      a way that the building needed to be 100% occupied within about six weeks of its reopening.
      This meant completing intakes for 3-5 new tenants each week during this period. Work
      closely with your supervisor to prioritize accordingly and ask for help as needed. I found it
      useful to have intake packets printed and organized before meeting with tenants and I
      developed a good routine of completing all the required paperwork while still acting warm
      and welcoming; such a practice is outside the scope of this guide, but in general I suggest
      making the intake friendly and conversational, while still addressing all the required questions
      for the paperwork.`

      title: '(4.3) Be (extra) flexible',
      content: `Lastly, and this is only a reiteration of 1.3, but throughout resyndication, and especially
      upon returning to the building, allow yourself to be flexible. In my opinion, you simply
      
      cannot be rigid in your expectations for what each day will look like while returning to the
      renovated MHL property. You may have three unexpected move-ins on a Friday, for
      example. You might think that such a thing could only happen due to a breakdown in
      communication between PM and RS, but during the Carlton lease-up this was not the case.
      Given the expedited lease-up process, we had various tenant applications and had to be
      prepared to move them in when they arrived. Two of the Friday move-in tenants may have been
      “scheduled” to sign leases and move in on Wednesday and Thursday, but if they did not
      appear at their appointments and then showed up on Friday, we of course moved them in
      on Friday. You might also be surprised that, for example, a resident that has not previously
      struggled with hoarding impulses, may have filled up their larger temporary unit with all
      kinds of new belongings that they will then attempt to stuff back into their SRO Mercy
      Housing unit. You may have a resident that is calling you in tears refusing to move back to
      your property at all, and they might be calling you while the relocation specialists and the
      movers are knocking at their door on their scheduled move-back date. You may need to
      directly contact construction managers at internet provider companies to figure out why
      none of the tenant phone/data/internet jacks appear to be hooked up. RS Staff for the
      Carlton faced all these situations and many more surprising scenes. So, take a deep breathe and remember that you have the entire MHL team here to support you.`
