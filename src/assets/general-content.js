      content: `During normal operations, a building’s RS team should maintain regular and productive
      communication with that site’s Property Management team. However, during resyndication the RS
      and PM teams might be working from different locations, and need to work closely with the MHL
      Development team, along with other internal and external partners at various stages of the process
      (such as MHL Resource Development, 3 rd -party relocation specialists, etc.) For these reason,
      consistent and open communication between team members is crucial throughout resyndication.
      Maintain your regular site team meetings, even if these are conducted via Zoom, and attend weekly
      calls with all parties (typically a Teams meeting organized by MHL Development).`

      title: '(1.2) Take notes and offer reminders',
      content: `As mentioned above, a crucial piece in the resyndication puzzle is the weekly zoom call. For the
      Carlton, this included relevant staff from MHL Development, PM, and RS, as well outside partners as
      needed. This call and follow-up emails provided us the floorplans and blueprints for the Carlton
      renovation from the partnered architecture firm, then the moving dates as coordinated by the
      partnered relocation specialists, and countless other important pieces of information throughout
      the resyndication process. I would encourage you to make note of decisions made on these calls
      independently. While there will ideally be a person delegated to make notes from the call and share them out following the meeting, from my
      experience with the Carlton I often found myself wondering, “Didn’t we agree to do x, but now I’m
      hearing y??” and wishing I had documentation of the conversation that I was trying to remember.`

      title: '(1.3) Be flexible',
      content: `While I think it will be useful to have records of these conversations and agreements, perhaps the single most important advice I can offer is to practice flexibility and expect
      to adjust on-the-fly. It will be best to communicate the same advice to your tenants. For example, during the Carlton’s relocation, tenants received no less than three different move-out dates. These changes and/or delays on the move-out date can be frustrating but are often outside of
      Mercy Housing’s control entirely, and certainly outside of Resident Services’ control.`
