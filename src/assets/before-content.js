      title: '(2.1) Maximize tenant participation in town hall meetings',
      content: `The MHL Development team, along with some combination of the architecture firm and the
      relocation specialists, should offer town hall style meetings to present their vision for the renovated
      property and a plan for the relocation process. This meeting should offer space for residents to
      provide feedback and ask questions. Make every attempt to achieve 100% resident attendance at
      these meetings. Once the paint has dried and tenants move back, construction has finished and so
      these community meetings will be residents’ only opportunity to provide their opinions on the
      renovations to occur in their homes.`

      title: '(2.2) Scrutinize blueprints and workplans',
      content: `Generally, there will not be a ton of room for negotiation as to the design plans for specific
      units. At the Carlton, no walls came down above the first floor, meaning that most units could not
      become any bigger (or smaller) and certain wish-list items that residents may have wanted (bigger
      closets, for example) will not be possible. However, at the Carlton various changes were made to
      units on each floor to accommodate disabled individuals with units that had hearing-impaired
      ringers or lower countertops, for example.
      Keep in mind that for your renovated RS space you will have the power to influence the
      direction of the renovation. Keep an eye on plans specifically for furniture, and for electrical and
      data jacks. One thing that we had never considered at the Carlton was that our RS space had been
      renovated to use automatic lighting, with no light switch on the wall. Upon returning, I wished we
      had the ability to turn off the lights for a weekly meditation group, but we could not receive this
      accommodation after the work had been completed.`

      title: '(2.3) Create relocation guide with PM input',
      content: `Finally, as construction plans are finalized and approved, and residents have been given their
      relocation units and tentative moving dates, begin creating a Relocation Guide to provide to
      tenants. It will be helpful for all relocated MHL tenants to receive a document explaining that they
      are still obligated to the terms of their lease with Mercy Housing. This means they will be expected
      to pay their tenant portion of rent, making out checks or money orders, just like they would under
      normal conditions. Solicit input from your PM team for this document; you will need to provide
      tenants with the mailing address for your property’s PM team. If the building undergoes a total
      rehab, mail service will be suspended for the property and rent payment will need to go to PM’s
      temporary office, perhaps at a different MHL property.
      If your resyndication property has the good luck of relocating most of your tenants to a single
      location (or neighborhood), then you should also consider researching the food pantries and other
      social service resources in that community. Since most Carlton tenants were relocated to a single
      building in Edgewater, in our relocation guide I included information about the nearest food pantry
      and on the CTA bus routes near the building. The partnered relocation specialists can be helpful
      
      here too, as (for the Carlton at least) they provided every tenant a USPS change-of-address request
      form.`
