      title: '(2.1) Maximize tenant participation in town hall meetings',
      content: `The RED team, along with some combination of the architecture firm and the
      relocation specialists, should offer town hall style meetings to present their vision for the renovated
      property and a plan for the relocation process. These meetings should offer space for residents to
      provide feedback and ask questions. Make every attempt to achieve 100% resident attendance at
      these meetings. Once the paint has dried and tenants move back, construction is complete. These community meetings will be residents’ only opportunity to provide their opinions on the
      renovations to occur in their homes. These meetings may occur in-person, but may also include an option for residents to call in and participate over the phone. If residents choose to call in, you may need to be available to assist with connecting them to the correct meeting.`

      title: '(2.2) Analyze blueprints and workplans',
      content: `Generally, there will not be a ton of room for negotiation as to the design plans for specific
      units. At the Carlton, no walls came down above the first floor, meaning that most units could not
      become any bigger (or smaller) and certain wish-list items that residents wanted (bigger
      closets, for example) were not possible. However, various changes were made to
      Carlton units on each floor to accommodate residents with disabilities, suchs as hearing-impaired
      doorbells or lower countertops.
      Keep in mind that you will have the ability to influence the
      direction of the renovation for the RS space. Keep an eye on plans specifically for furniture options, electrical and
      data jack placements. One thing we never considered at the Carlton was our RS space renovation included automatic lighting, with no light switch on the wall to control it. Upon returning, I wished we
      had the ability to turn off the lights for a weekly meditation group, but we could not receive this
      accommodation after the work was complete.`

      title: '(2.3) Create a relocation guide with PM input',
      content: `Finally, as construction plans are finalized and approved, and residents receive their
      relocation units and tentative moving dates, begin creating a Relocation Guide to provide to
      tenants. It will be helpful for all relocated MHL tenants to receive a document explaining that they
      are still obligated to the terms of their lease with Mercy Housing. This means they will be expected
      to pay their tenant portion of rent, submitting checks or money orders, just like they would under
      normal circumstances. Solicit input from your PM team for this document; you will need to provide
      tenants with the mailing address for your PM team. If the building undergoes a total
      rehab, mail service will be suspended for the property and rent payment will need to go to PM’s
      temporary office, perhaps at a different MHL property.
      If your resyndication property has the good luck of relocating most of your tenants to a single
      location (or neighborhood), then you should also consider researching the food pantries and other
      social service resources in that community. Since most Carlton tenants were relocated to a single
      building in Edgewater, in our relocation guide I included information about the nearest food pantry
      and the CTA bus routes near the building. The partnered relocation specialists can be helpful
      here too, as (for the Carlton at least) they provided every tenant a USPS change-of-address request
      form upon their relocation.`
