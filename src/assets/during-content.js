      title: '(3.1) Wellbeing checks for high-risk residents',
      content: `With your tenants out of the property, you are now fully in the relocation phase of the
      resyndication process. Depending on details specific to your property, you may find this new and
      temporary workflow to be either more or less stressful than the regular day-to-day Case Manager
      experience. In general, I tried to maintain the same workflow as usual. At the beginning of each
      month, I prioritized the annual and six-month updates for my funded residents, reaching out to
      them and arranging to meet them at a neutral location to complete this paperwork. For the Carlton,
      we had the good luck of being offered common area space at the primary relocation property for RS
      staff to set-up shop. I created a Google Voice number to communicate with residents from my
      cell phone (without using my actual cell phone number) and arranged for them to meet me in the common area as needed.
      Some of your property's residents likely have a greater level of
      self-sufficiency and do not engage much with Resident Services. Just like under
      normal circumstances, these residents should handle relocation without incident, although you may
      need to stress the temporary nature of their move (see 3.3). However, certain high-risk tenants,
      whether relocated inside or outside of MHL, will benefit from even more attention and outreach
      than provided at your property. Consider visiting your high-risk tenants early and often throughout
      relocation, particularly if they are consistently unavailable by telephone. One resident from the Carlton
      had been, due to cognitive decline from aging and drinking, consistently unable to use a telephone. I
      made sure to assist him with rent payment each month and provided more than one “walking tour”
      of his new neighborhood, ensuring he could get to the nearest grocery store and currency exchange.
      Of course, the specific needs of your tenants may be different and may require different approaches.`

      title: '(3.2) Form a relationship with outside (relocation) housing provider management when possible',
      content: `For the duration of the construction project, your tenants will have two property managers. They will still be tenants with MHL and pay rent to the PM team for your property,
      and (at least on paper) be expected to follow the House Rules laid out in their MHL lease. However,
      they will be physically living at a different location with a different management team for some period of time, and that
      team will do their best to ensure safe and equitable living conditions for all their tenants,
      including their MHL transplants. As much as possible, attempt to form a working relationship with
      the staff at the relocation property.
      I imagine this relationship will look different based on the details of the specific property or
      properties where tenants are placed for relocation. For example, all your MHL tenants might be
      in a large building that has a spare office space which the building management will allow you to use
      during business hours, and you can create a makeshift temporary office not so different from the
      regular RS spaces in MHL properties. On the other hand, all your tenants might be scattered into
      various two- or three-flat properties with no common areas to meet in. The reality will probably be
      in the middle of these two extremes. For the Carlton’s relocation, most tenants were at a large
      apartment complex (about 300 units) in which the property manager graciously allowed RS staff to work from a
      
      table in the hallway across from the mailboxes. I would make myself available to tenants in this
      space three times a week, while working from a temporary office at MHL's Miriam Apartments the rest of the time.`

      title: '(3.3) Stress the temporary nature of relocation to tenants wanting to stay at relocation units',
      content: `In their communications with tenants, starting from the initial meetings months prior to
      resyndication (see 2.1), the relocation specialists will inform residents that they will be temporarily
      moved into market-rate housing for the duration of construction, and that they are free to apply for
      a lease and thereby to stay at the temporary housing, without Mercy Housing’s assistance. As you
      might imagine, certain residents will use their selective hearing to understand this to mean that they
      are free to stay at their temporary apartment indefinitely, under the same terms and conditions of
      their MHL lease. Firmly push back against this misunderstanding.
      Residents that can afford to enter a standard, unsubsidized lease agreement with the temporary
      housing provider are certainly free to do so, and some Carlton tenants did exactly that. However,
      many MHL residents have not rented without the support of a subsidy in years, if ever. Explain to
      these residents that they would need to apply, the same way any other renter would, for tenancy,
      and then need to meet the landlord’s expectations for credit, criminal background, and minimum
      income. A person living on a fixed income from Social Security at $914 per month, for example,
      would not be approved for an apartment that charges $900 per month for rent. Moreover, applying for that
      apartment might cost them a non-refundable application fee. You will do well to have a prepared
      simple explanation as to the nature of the resident’s lease with MHL, because another set of
      residents will be under the impression that their “voucher” is transferable, like a Section 8 voucher
      would be. We are not housing counselors and as RS staff we are not even housing providers, so
      while you can certainly assist residents in getting on various waitlists, or attempting to secure
      transferable rental assistance, you are not able to offer rent subsidies for our residents to move into
      new housing. It is best to be clear and straightforward in the requirement of returning to your MHL property
      if a resident would like to keep their rental subsidy.`

      title: '(3.4) Request funds for travel reimbursement and stamped envelopes to provide tenants',
      content: `The amount of money a case manager needs will change during relocation. On the one hand,
      you will not be able to host regular groups and building events such as monthly birthday parties or
      coffee hours. On the other hand, you will have increased transportation costs (whether driving or
      using public transit) incurred from visiting tenants. You will also benefit from having a supply of
      stamps and envelopes to assist residents with rent payment. If your residents are walking distance
      from your building’s temporary PM location, all the better, but in most cases at least some tenants
      will prefer to mail their rent. Discuss with your manager how to secure this funding, and make sure
      you have access to the latest MHL mileage reimbursement forms.`

      title: '(3.5) Participate and solicit tenant participation with community art partners',
      content: `Finally, all the recent MHL syndications have included a partnership with a community arts
      organization that will assist in the creation and installation of artwork to celebrate the building’s
      renovation. For the Carlton at least, this part of the process was rather smooth and during our weekly resyndication call, the RED team introduced a representative from Architreasures,
      the community art organization responsible for soliciting custom original artwork installations for
      the renovated property. This representative gave us an array of artist applications to consider and
      
      asked for our help in picking one artist for the job. Once landing on an artist, they reached out to us
      for help involving tenants in creating some of the murals. The role of RS here, much like with the
      community meetings prior to resyndication, amounts to maximizing tenant engagement. Attempt
      to sell your residents on the opportunity to participate in making the art that they will be seeing
      every day once they have returned to the property.`
